The Colab notebook in this repository will remove a large amount of files from Google Drive. 
I casually uploaded files in the root folder and I ended up having several thoundand images in my Drive root folder. It currently seems that Google won't let you delete large amount of file with a click.
This notebook is intended as a workaround that worked to me. 
I'm sharing It here in case It may be useful to someone.
